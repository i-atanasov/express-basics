Create an Express.js project that will expose three endpoints:

A GET endpoint to return a dummy object
A POST endpoint that will get user input and return an object that will have the data passed
A DELETE endpoint that will take an id parameter (something like users/{userid})
All responses should return the correct response code. 
Create a middleware that will be added everywhere. 
The middleware should just print something in the console, no specific functionality is required.

Out of scope:

Authentication
Persisting the data
Typescript
